# infrabel-hackathon

Results of a one-day hackathon at Infrabel, trying to build an understanding of traffic jams on rail. Which segments of the rail network increase delay and which ones actually catch up delay? Can we detect trains being stuck in a traffic jam? Tooling used is Postgres + Python (see notebook) and Redash. The findings are in presentation.pdf. I hope this is a useful example of how to use the Infrabel data to do some data discovery / data analysis / data science. https://opendata.infrabel.be/

DISCLAIMER: This code is nothing more than a 4-hour hack and in order to reproduce it, you need to download the file I mention in the notebook and install a local postgres database. Also, before drawing any business conclusions, all calculations need to be validated and you have to process more than one day of data.
